## By October 2024

At the end of year 1, we have a set of deliverables that need to be completed and another set that need major progress in order to meet our requirements.

- Simulation team (1.6 funded FTE) will 
	- *Complete* Sim 1.1 "Sim. realistic catalogs of SNe Ia and non-SNe Ia data for Infrastructure Dev."
	- *Complete* Sim 1.2 "Simulate Pixel images to test Photometry/Calibration"
	- *Complete* Sim 1.4 "Aid the community in optimizing the design of the HLTDS via catalog sims."

- Calibration team (0.78 funded FTE) will 
	- *Complete* Determine data input source (do we need something in addition to Level 2 and a few sample level 1 data)
	- Cal 2.1 "Characterize and mitigate detector effects to levels of 0.3% over 11 mags"
		- Develop calibration procedures with sRCS and lab test data.
	- Cal 2.2 "Characterize passband throughputs and their field Dependence to 1 Å"
		- Develop a testing strategy in order to prove this requirement on simulated data.
	- Cal 2.3 "Constrain prism spectral response across observing field to 0.2% per 5000 Å"
		- Develop a testing strategy in order to prove this requirement on simulated data.

- Photometry team (1.96 funded FTE) will 
	- Phot 3.1 "Build a general-use, ~~rapid~~ transient discovery pipeline"
		* Coordinated with RAPPID
		- support RAPPID in using Wang+ 2022 simulated data to characterize purity & quality of current subtraction tools.
	- Phot 3.2 "Develop, test, and validate a scene-modeling pipeline with < 2 mmag bias"
		- Use Wang+ 2022 simulated images as input to methods developed in Rubin & Cikota 2021(ish).

- Spectroscopy team (0.75 funded FTE) will
	- Spec 4.1 "Remove self-contamination from the host galaxy by linear reconstruction"
		- support simulation team to get Sim 1.3 - Simulate 3D datacubes and 2D spectra to test Spectral Extraction
	- Spec 4.2 "Subtract local background"
		- support simulation team to get Sim 1.3 - Simulate 3D datacubes and 2D spectra to test Spectral Extraction

- Characterization team (0.25 funded FTE) will
	- *Complete* Char 5.1 "Create infrastructure for classification of light curves"
		* Coordinated with RAPPID, especially for transients discovered outside the RAPPID pipeline

- Community Support/Observational Strategy (0.41 funded FTE) team will
	- *Complete* OS 6.1 "Design tools for Community Input on Observing Strategy"
	- *Complete* OS 6.2 "Build Observing Strategy Quick Assessment Capabilities"

- Cosmology analysis team will
	- *Complete* Cos 7.1 (0.21 funded FTE) "Enhance cosmology pipeline Pippin for rapid Roman forecasting"

- Data management team will
	- Cat 8.1 (0.08 funded FTE) "Create a database to organize transient event data products"
		* Coordinated with RAPPID's transient catalog to store our additional data products (re-calibrated pixels, SMP light curves, ...)

Additionally, we will have a end-to-end pipeline that is able to run on a subsample of Roman simulated data as a baseline for the current state of the art.


### In year 2

By the end of year two we will complete work on Cal 2.1, Cal 2.2, Cal 2.3, Phot 3.1, Phot 3.2, Spec 4.1, Spec 4.2, and Cat 8.1. Deliverables Sim 1.3, Char 5.3, and Cos 7.2 are small enough that they can be started and completed in year 2.
